##### binary_revolution_0

Intel has been found that IG-88 is planning some kind of revolution. The Rebels seek to destroy the murderous droid before its bloody revolution. At IG-88's lab, the Rebels find that IG-88 is not a unique designation, and those copies stand guard.  

###### binary_revolution_1

> Despite Fenn's bravery; he's wounded first by an HK Assadsin Droid. No matter how many the Rebels chop down, more spawn. 

###### binary_revolution_2

> Gaarkhan triumphantly knocks down the door, only to release more copies of IG-88. The Rebels mission is clear: destroy all copies.  

###### binary_revolution_3

> With the Rebels distracted, an HK Assassin Droid lands a wounding shot on Jyn. If all four heroes are wounded they'll be forced to withdraw. 

###### binary_revolution_4

> Jyn Odan takes out one of the IG-88 copies. One copy and the original remain.  

###### binary_revolution_5

> An IG-88 copy wounds Gaarkhan, heals, and then runs away as it buys time.  

###### binary_revolution_6

> Reinforcements pile in, wounding Diala, and the Rebels are forced to retreat. For the assistance rendered by the Empire, IG-88 has agreed to help it in future endeavors.
