Imperial Forces bear down on Echo Base and the base&apos;s power stations are down (represented by mission tokens). If the Rebels can activate the power stations, they&apos;ll have a fighting chance to repel the Imperials; buying their allies precious time to evacuate.

###### battle_of_hoth_0

> The Rebels spread out quickly to activate the four power stations. Verena Talos positions for Close Quarters; using the vanquished SC2-M Repulsor Tank against Dengar. 

###### battle_of_hoth_1

> Diala Passil fends off Snowtroopers while activating the third power station.

###### battle_of_hoth_2

> The destruction of the SC2-M Repulsor Tank clears the way for Saska Teft (played by a LEGO Friend's figure) to activate on the final power station.

At this point, the Rebels final task is to kill all remaining Imperials.

###### battle_of_hoth_3

> Diala Passil barely survives (with 2 HP remaining) the onslought of two Snowtroopers and an exploding Probe Droid.

###### battle_of_hoth_4

> A single Imperial Officer stands with 1 HP before Verena Talos coldy executes him; securing victory for the Rebels.
