While assisting Han Solo in some unscrupulous work, the Rebels are ambushed by Imperial forces! The Rebels must retrieve an access disk from the blue terminal and bring it back to the red terminal. The Imperials must retrieve the schematic from the red terminal and upload it to the blue terminal.

Shortly before the Rebels obtain the access disk, the Royal Guard Champion is deployed.

> The Royal Guard Champion posseses the schematic, and needs a single turn to upload it. Loku does what he can to delay the Imperial.

> The Stormtroopers wound Jyn Odan causing her to drop the access disk. Gaarkhan picks up the access disk and opens the airlock in time securing victory for the Rebels.
