##### survival_of_the_fittest_0

A faint distress signal has been found, originating from a survivor of the Battle of Hoth. The Rebels' rescue speeder crashes, separating them. The wind is thick, and most of the terrain is out of sight. Fenn, Gaarkhan, and Echo Base Trooper "Reddy" spot a Probe droid and prepare for combat. Diala, Jyn, and Echo Base Trooper "Bluey", met with a hungry Wampa, begin their fight.

###### survival_of_the_fittest_1

> "Reddy" narrowly avoids a disemboweling from the hungry Wampa to scout ahead. Diala cleans up what's left of the Wampa.

###### survival_of_the_fittest_2

> Unfortunately for "Bluey" he's ambushed by Snowtroopers and meets his demise. 

###### survival_of_the_fittest_3

> Between Dengar at his rear and Snowtroopers in front, Ghaarkhan is wounded. 

###### survival_of_the_fittest_4

> Jyn Odan discovers the cavern with the survivor inside. He appears to be a living snack for a menacing Wampa.  

###### survival_of_the_fittest_5

> After wounding Jyn, the Wampa turns his attention to Diala. Lucky for her the force is with her as she dodges a crippling blow. 

###### survival_of_the_fittest_6

> Diala runs for the survivor, and successfully revives him. The victorious Rebels signal their ship and secure the man for transport.
