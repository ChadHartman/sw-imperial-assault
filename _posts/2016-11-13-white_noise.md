A hologram with valuable intel has been located! However, C-3PO is the only one in the Alliance who can translate the hologram (represented by the neutral mission token). The Rebels must escort him there safely before the Imperials destroy him.

###### white_noise_1

> While the Rebel heroes clear a path to the hologram, C-3PO is positioned to a safe location. Unfortunately Trandoshian Hunters have been deployed and take out R2-D2. C-3PO is their next prey. 

###### white_noise_2
